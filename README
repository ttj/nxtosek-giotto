This is the README file for giottoc.

giottoc is a Java implementation of a compiler for the embedded
programming language Giotto and a distributed target machine called
the embedded machine written in C.  Giotto is being developed at the
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department of the
University of California at Berkeley.  For more information see:

http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~fresco/giotto

giottoc 0.3 is intended as a preliminary version of the Giotto
compiler and the embedded machine.  The Giotto syntax can be found in
the 'giottoc.grammar' file.  This release includes a Giotto example
program 'control.giotto', which contains all key features of the
programming language Giotto.  The file is located in the 'examples'
subdirectory of the distribution.  For installation instructions
please refer to the INSTALL file, which also provides information on
how to run giottoc on Windows as well as the distributed version of
the target machine on Linux.
