This project is a port of [Henzinger](http://mtc.epfl.ch/~tah/), Horowitz, Matic, [Kirsch](http://cs.uni-salzburg.at/~ck/), Sanvido, and Ghosal's Giotto E-machine implementation in C for OSEK and pthreads to [nxtOSEK](http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net), an OSEK-compliant operating system for [Lego Mindstorms NXT](http://mindstorms.lego.com).  The only E-machine implementations for Giotto on Lego we could find appeared to be for the older Mindstorms RCX, so we decided to make this port.

You can [read more about Giotto at its home at Berkeley](http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/giotto/).  The source code this port is based upon [is available on the Berkeley site as well](http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/giotto/download.html), under the heading "E Machine implementation for C (pthreads and OSEK)".

To use this with the nxtOSEK operating system, place the code in a new directory in the nxtosek/samples directory, and compile using the normal "make all" which will generate the binary image called "emac.rxe". Note: if you do not place the code in a directory like nxtosek/samples/projectName/trunk/src, you will have to modify some paths in the makefile.
